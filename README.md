# Public technical documents for Things services at Bluewind

![Things logo](assets/logo_things.png)

This project contains useful documentation regarding Things services offered by
Bluewind to selected clients as a proof of concept of a cloud based IoT structure.

Things services are located at [this website address](http://things.bluewind.it)
but technical documentation is maintained here in this repository in order to
encourage collaboration and discussion on the subject.

### Note on using Things services

Bluewind Things is a cloud based set of services for IoT. It's heavily based
on open standards and components, namely MQTT and wrapping Ruby services.

It's very easily customized for any simple and medium complexity usage and fits
very well the needs of a demonstration application and proof of concept.

In case you're interested at using the platform please drop an email and you
will be contacted with details.
